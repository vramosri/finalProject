#And so you finally arrive at the castle after days of traveling and helping those in&need. You arrive with @ coins to your name.
#However, this is not enough to buy all the wares you sought out for. You live there for&a while, trying to sell your goods to the citizens of the palace. At least part of your&dream came true for you have made it to the palace!
#This is enough for a decent living in the palace. You make yourself a home there and&live a decent life as a merchant, selling your goods to those who live in this&beautiful palace!
#You have made it. You have enough coins to build a grand home and live out your dream.&But that isn't enough. You remember your days helping people in need, and spend your&life in the palace aiding those who need your help. Your dream has come true!
